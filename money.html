        <h2>What Is Money?</h2>
        <p>Money is an <b>economic unit</b> that functions as a generally recognized medium of exchange for transactional
        purposes in an economy. Money provides the service of reducing transaction cost, namely the double
        coincidence of wants. Money originates in the form of a commodity, having a physical property to be
        adopted by market participants as a medium of exchange. Money can be: market-determined, officially
        issued legal tender or fiat moneys, money substitutes and fiduciary media, and electronic
        cryptocurrencies.</p>
        <h2>Functions of Money</h2>
        <P>Money primarily functions as a medium of exchange. However, it also has developed
        secondary functions that derive from its use as a medium of exchange. These other functions include:
        1) a unit of account, 2) a store of value, and 3) a standard of deferred payment.</P>
        <p>There are several types of money. Apart from which I will give information on<u><I>Cryptocurrencies</I></u>
        <h6>Cryptocurrencies</h6> are peer-based money, such as bitcoin. This type of money is electronically based on
        electronic accounting entries that can be used as a <del>mode</del> medium of exchange. Cryptocurrencies share many
        characteristics of both market-determined money and fiat money. Cryptocurrencies are a type of money
        that can be used to facilitate international transactions.Cryptocurrencies first originated as
        accounting units assigned to users as compensation in return for helping to process and verify
        transactions in a cryptocurrency <strong>blockchain</strong>. They have also evolved to become a new form
        of coin offering that helps to serve as financing for new technological business initiatives and companies.
        Cryptocurrencies are becoming more widely used and adopted as a medium of exchange for daily
        transactions. However, cryptocurrencies do pose many risks. As such, they are being researched and
        regulated by authorities on an ongoing basis.</p>
